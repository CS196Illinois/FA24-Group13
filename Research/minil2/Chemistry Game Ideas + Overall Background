Overall Background
- genral map of the entire UIUC campusm, doesn't neccesary include all of the deatils and building (if we have time we can)
- main Quad will be the center of the map, and the math, chemistry, astronomy building will be around
- the animate character (player) should start from the main quad, to begin the game the player has to choose the where 
  they want to go out of the three
- option to take the bus or walk (animation should be present on the actual map)
- the big map should then zoom into the specific buidling
- Tilemap should be good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTp5zi8_u1U

Chemistry Annex building
- Chemistry Annex building is the closet to the main quad 
- locate the player in a lab + element combination game #1
  - the player should combine the given element reprsent by symbol to make it into different element (picture output)
  - 1). given air + earth + water + fire

  - 2). player need to assemble the pieces into a correct ion model according to the characteristics of

  - 3). help player deepn their understanding of ionic chemistry 

Pros
- easy to execute for the first game
- two user input = combination output (simple if + elseif)
- picture are easy to find

Cons
