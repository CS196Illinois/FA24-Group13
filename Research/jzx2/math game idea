math department at uiuc:
- located in altgeld hall: right next to illini uinion
  - very old school looking
- some notable figures

battle system: wizardy to play into the old school look of the building
- the player travels through the building (make it look run down) but is confronted with ghosts and monsters
- defeat the monsters by solving whatever problem they have over their heads
- thinking smth like this game from google doodle: https://g.co/kgs/Cfohskt
- three stages:
  - 1) addition and subtractoin
  - 2) ^ + multiplication
  - 3) ^ + division
- cut scenes from stage to stage could have info about notable figures

pros: 
- very clear idea with precendent to look at
- decently easy to execute
- easy to add to in the future

cons:
- needs extra artwork/backgrounds (bc there will be three stages)
